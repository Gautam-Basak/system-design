User Wallet Payment Process Explained

Of course. This is an excellent exercise to bridge the gap between high-level architecture and real-world user experience. Let's walk through the entire journey step-by-step, from user creation to making a payment, detailing what happens under the hood.
We'll follow two primary user stories:
1.	User Registration & Wallet Creation
2.	Making a Payment (e.g., paying a electricity bill)

________________________________________
Story 1: User Registration & Wallet Creation
User Perspective:
1.	You download the "FinTechApp" and open it.
2.	You tap "Sign Up."
3.	You enter your phone number, email, and create a password.
4.	You verify your phone number and email via OTP (One-Time Password) codes sent to you.
5.	You are logged in and prompted to "Create Your Wallet."
6.	You enter your full name and perhaps your date of birth. You accept the terms and conditions.
7.	You see a screen: "Your wallet has been created successfully!" with a balance of ₹0.00.

What Happens Under the Hood (System Perspective):

Step 1: API Gateway - The Front Door
•	Your phone sends an HTTP POST /api/users/signup request with your signup data (phone, email, password).
•	This request hits the API Gateway first. The gateway performs basic checks: Is the request formatted correctly? Is it a valid JSON?

Step 2: User Service - Creating Your Identity
•	The API Gateway routes the request to the User Service.
•	The User Service hashes your password (using bcrypt or similar) for security.
•	It creates a new user record in its PostgreSQL database with a status of UNVERIFIED.
•	It publishes an event UserCreatedEvent to a Kafka topic, say user-events. This event contains your user ID, phone number, and email.
o	{ "event_id": "abc123", "type": "USER_CREATED", "user_id": "user_678", "phone": "+91XXXXXX", "email": "user@example.com" }

Step 3: Notification Service - Sending OTP
•	The Notification Service is listening to the user-events topic.
•	It sees the UserCreatedEvent.
•	It generates two OTPs (one for phone, one for email) and stores them in Redis with a short expiration time (e.g., 5 minutes). The key might be otp:user_678:phone and the value is the code.
•	It calls third-party providers (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email) to send the actual OTP messages to you.
Step 4: User Verification
•	You enter the OTPs. Your phone sends a POST /api/users/verify request with the codes.
•	The API Gateway routes this to the User Service.
•	The User Service checks the codes against the values stored in Redis. If they match, it updates your user status to VERIFIED in its database.
Step 5: Wallet Creation
•	You click "Create Wallet." Your phone sends a POST /api/wallets request.
•	The API Gateway routes this to the Wallet Service.
•	The Wallet Service:
o	Authorizes the request by validating the JWT token attached to it (proving you are a verified user).
o	Creates a new wallet in its sharded PostgreSQL database. The initial balance is set to 0.00, and the status is ACTIVE.
o	It also creates an initial ledger entry in a transactions table for "Wallet Creation."
o	It caches your wallet balance (0.00) and ID in Redis for future fast reads. The key might be balance:user_678.
•	A success response is sent back to your phone. You now have a wallet!

Story 2: Making a Payment (Paying an Electricity Bill)

User Perspective:
1.	You are logged into the FinTechApp.
2.	You navigate to "Pay Bills" -> "Electricity."
3.	You select your electricity provider and enter your Customer ID.
4.	The app fetches and shows your bill amount, say ₹1,500.
5.	You click "Pay Now."
6.	You might be asked to enter your MPIN for security.
7.	You see a loading spinner for a second.
8.	You get a notification: "Payment of ₹1,500 to BESCOM Electricity was successful. Your updated balance is ₹3,500." (assuming you had ₹5,000 before).
What Happens Under the Hood (System Perspective):

Step 1: Initiation and Validation
•	You click "Pay Now." Your phone sends a POST /api/transactions/pay request. This request contains your JWT token, the biller details, the amount, and your MPIN.
•	The API Gateway receives the request. It:
o	Validates the JWT token to ensure you are logged in.
o	Applies rate limiting (e.g., no more than 10 transactions per minute from this user).
o	Routes the request to the Wallet Service.

Step 2: Pre-Transaction Checks (Synchronous)
•	The Wallet Service receives the request.
•	It validates your MPIN against a stored hash.
•	It checks your cached balance in Redis (balance:user_678). Is 5000 >= 1500? Yes.
•	It performs an optimistic lock or uses a Redis distributed lock based on your user_id to prevent double-spending (e.g., if you hit "Pay" twice very quickly). This is a critical step.
•	It places a temporary hold on the ₹1,500. It doesn't deduct it yet, but it ensures those funds are reserved. It might update the cached balance to a "locked" state or use a separate locked_balance field.

Step 3: Event Publishing (The Handoff)
•	The Wallet Service now publishes a TransactionInitiatedEvent to a Kafka topic named transaction-requests.
o	{ "event_id": "txn_987", "type": "DEBIT", "user_id": "user_678", "amount": 1500, "biller_id": "bescom_123", "status": "PENDING" }
•	Immediately after publishing, the Wallet Service sends a 202 Accepted response back to your phone. This means "We've received your request and are processing it." This is why you see the spinner disappear quickly—the synchronous part is over.

Step 4: Asynchronous Processing (The Real Work)
•	The Transaction Service is listening to the transaction-requests topic.
•	It consumes the TransactionInitiatedEvent.
•	It begins processing the transaction. This is where the SAGA pattern might come into play to manage distributed transactions across services.

Step 5: Fraud Check
•	The Transaction Service first calls the Fraud Detection Service (or publishes a new event for it to consume).
•	The Fraud Service, using its ML model, analyzes the transaction: "User usually pays ₹1,200-1,800 for electricity in Bangalore. This is normal. Low risk."
•	It responds with an APPROVED status.

Step 6: Executing the Debit
•	The Transaction Service, upon fraud approval, now tells the Wallet Service to finalize the debit.
•	The Wallet Service performs the final, atomic SQL update in its database: UPDATE wallets SET balance = balance - 1500 WHERE user_id = 'user_678';.
•	It updates the cached balance in Redis to 3500.
•	It releases the temporary lock on the funds.

Step 7: Confirming with the Biller
•	The Transaction Service now calls an external API of the electricity provider (BESCOM) to settle the payment. This is done via a Bank Transfer / Withdrawal Service which handles the complex banking integrations (UPI, NETC, etc.).
•	The biller's API confirms the payment was received.

Step 8: Final Logging and Notification
•	The Transaction Service updates the transaction status to SUCCESS in its database (which could be a sharded PostgreSQL or a write-optimized NoSQL like MongoDB for auditing).
•	It publishes a TransactionSuccessEvent to a Kafka topic like notifications.
•	The Notification Service listens to this topic and sends the SMS and push notification to your phone.
•	The Notification Service might also listen to the event and send a receipt email.

This entire process (Steps 4-8) happens asynchronously in the background within milliseconds, even after your app has already received the "processing" response. This event-driven, asynchronous flow is the key to handling millions of transactions per second without making users wait.
My first doubt. You said this part is synchronous - Immediately after publishing, the Wallet Service sends a 202 Accepted response back to your phone. This means "We've received your request and are processing it." This is why you see the spinner disappear quickly—the synchronous part is over. But many user can do it simultaneouly right. Or you means synchronour means unless my first transaction event is published or upto the spinner is rotating I cannot make further payment
Excellent question! You've hit on a crucial and subtle point in distributed system design. Let me clarify.
You are absolutely right: Many users can do this simultaneously. The system is designed to handle that.
The term "synchronous" in this context does not mean "one at a time." It refers to the nature of the communication between your phone (the client) and the server.
Let's break it down:
1. Synchronous Request-Response (The Part You See)
This is the interaction between your phone and the Wallet Service.
•	What happens: Your phone sends a request and then waits, holding the connection open, for an immediate response from the server.
•	Analogy: It's like calling a friend and asking, "Can you handle this for me?" You stay on the line until they say "Yes, I got it" or "No, I can't."
•	In our case: Your phone sends the "Pay Now" request and waits. The Wallet Service must send back a response (like 200 OK, 202 Accepted, or 400 Bad Request) within a short timeframe (e.g., 1-2 seconds), or your phone will assume the request failed and show an error. The spinner on your screen rotates during this wait.
This is "synchronous" from the client's perspective. The client's process is blocked until it gets a response.
2. How It Handles Many Simultaneous Users
The "synchronous" part above is handled by multiple instances of the Wallet Service running behind a Load Balancer.
•	User A's phone sends a request. It gets routed by the load balancer to Wallet Service Instance 1.
•	User B's phone sends a request at the exact same time. The load balancer sends it to Wallet Service Instance 2.
•	User C's phone sends a request. It might go to Wallet Service Instance 3, or back to Instance 1 if Instance 1 has already finished with User A.
Each instance handles its own request completely independently. They all perform the checks (balance, MPIN, locking) and publish their events to Kafka concurrently. This is how the system achieves high throughput and handles millions of users.
3. The Locking Mechanism (Preventing Your Double-Spending)
Now, to your specific point: "unless my first transaction... I cannot make further payment."
This is also correct, but it's managed by the locking mechanism, not by the synchronous call itself.
•	When the Wallet Service gets your request, the first thing it does is acquire a lock based on your user_id.
•	This lock is stored in Redis because it's incredibly fast and supports distributed locks.
•	The logic is: "If a lock for user_678 exists, don't let any other process (for the same user) proceed. Make it wait until the lock is released."
So, what happens if you smash the "Pay" button twice?
1.	Request #1 arrives at Wallet Service Instance 1. It acquires the lock for user_678 and starts working.
2.	Request #2 (the duplicate) arrives just milliseconds later at Wallet Service Instance 2.
3.	Instance 2 tries to acquire the lock for user_678. It sees the lock is already taken by Instance 1.
4.	Instance 2 will wait for a few milliseconds for the lock to be released. If the lock isn't released quickly, it will immediately fail the request and send a response back to your phone like: "Transaction already in progress."
This ensures that even if you send two simultaneous requests, only one will succeed in reserving the funds and creating a transaction event. The other will be rejected.
Summary: Clearing the Doubt
Your Concern	The Reality
"Synchronous means one user at a time?"	No. The synchronous API can handle thousands of different users simultaneously via load balancing and multiple service instances.
"I cannot make further payment until first is done?"	Yes, but only for your own account. The lock on your user_id prevents you from double-spending. Other users are completely unaffected and can trade freely.
The synchronous phase is about getting a quick, definitive acknowledgment from the system that your request is valid and has been accepted for processing. The complex, time-consuming work of actually completing the payment is handed off to the asynchronous, event-driven backend (Kafka and the other services), which is built to handle immense volume.
